Keyboard Navigation
===
An essential part of the Accessibility module is the added keyboard navigation support. This is obviously a critical feature for users with mobility impairments, but also benefits all users. While using a computer mouse can be faster, keyboard navigation allows all users access to precise navigation of the chart.

By including the Accessibility module with your charts, users are able to navigate and interact with the data points, chart menu, and other chart controls using the keyboard only.
