Voice input
===

New since Highcharts version 7.1 is support for voice input software. Similarly to keyboard navigation, this is a technology that is beneficial to users with mobility impairments, but has potential benefits for all users.

Highcharts allows users of voice input software to interact with chart controls such as the chart menu using voice commands. Examples of compatible software include Nuance Dragon, and Microsoft Windows Speech Recognition.
