Tactile Export
===
As long as the [exporting module](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/export-module/export-module-overview) is included alongside the Accessibility module, users can download an SVG version of the chart. This SVG can be printed and turned into a tactile graphic using embossing printers or similar technology.
