Cognitive Accessibility
===
A lot of Highcharts features are developed with the goal of making charts easier to use and understand. This translates to better cognitive accessibility, as well as an improved user experience for all users. Relevant features that can be tested out in the chart below, include tooltips, chart legends, dimming surrounding content on hover, series labels, viewing charts in full screen, and data table support.
