With the accessibility module, Highcharts comes with built in support for Windows High Contrast Mode. Charts can also be viewed in full screen for additional separation of elements. [Pattern fills](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/accessibility/accessibility-features/patterns-and-contrast) are supported, as well as [premade themes](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-design-and-style/themes) with higher contrast. Series markers also have different shapes to help distinguish between data points without use of color. Due to the responsive nature of Highcharts, screen zooming tools are well supported.
